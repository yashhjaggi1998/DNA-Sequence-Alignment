# DNA-Sequence-Alignment

It is a python project to solve the DNA Sequence Alignment problem. 
Conventionally, using  dynamic programming is not efficient as the DNA sequences can be in billions. 
Thus, we need to introduce divide and conquer approach to recursively apply dynamic programming on smaller sequences.
